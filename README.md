# Ghibli DB

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing a simple project that uses the Ghibli API (https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) as the backend and Razor Pages as the frontend, implemented in C#. This project uses Test-Driven Development (TDD) and includes a set of tests to ensure the correctness of the code.

The project allows users to view a list of movies from the Ghibli studio, view details of each movie, and search for movies by title. The project uses the Ghibli API to retrieve the data and the Razor Pages framework to handle the frontend functionality.

To run the project, you will need to have the .NET Core SDK installed on your computer and some basic understanding of C# and Razor Pages. Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the solution in Visual Studio and run the project from there.

The project uses the TDD approach, which means that the tests were written before the implementation of the features. This approach allows for a more robust and maintainable codebase. The tests can be found in the project's solution.

If you find any errors or bugs in the project or if you have any suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

This repository is intended to be a starting point for those who are new to Razor Pages and working with APIs, and as you become more familiar with the tools and techniques, you may want to explore more advanced topics and features.

Thank you for visiting this repository and happy coding!
